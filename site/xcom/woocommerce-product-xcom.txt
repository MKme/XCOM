WHAT YOU'RE GETTING
- Offline-ready web app (PWA): installable on iOS/Android/Desktop. Once loaded, it keeps working without signal.
- Local-first data: personal lists and logs stay on your device (no accounts required).
- Offline mapping: set an AO and cache map tiles for that area to keep maps usable offline.
- Operator-focused tools: repeaters, packet nodes, shortwave schedules, callsign lookup, logging, and more.

KEY MODULES
- Predict: offline callsign lookup (USA/Canada), path plotting, and a quick HF prediction tool.
- Repeaters: find repeaters by radius/band/mode and view tones, offsets, notes, and distance.
- Packet Stations: map packet nodes/BBS and keep a personal local list.
- Shortwave Broadcasts: browse worldwide HF schedules by time ("what's on now") or by frequency.
- Map: XTOC-style tactical map + offline raster tile caching, plus Mesh nodes (Meshtastic / MeshCore / OpenMANET) with optional node-to-roster assignment, and an Imported overlay for XTOC packet markers/zones (type toggles; last 7 days rendered by default). Select a marker and choose “Hide from map” to declutter.
- XTOC Comm: create/import structured packets (CLEAR or SECURE). Source Unit(s) supports multi-select for SITREP/TASK/CONTACT/RESOURCE/ASSET/ZONE, plus multi-unit CHECKIN/LOC. Chunk for tight message limits, move by copy/paste/QR/mesh/MANET (LAN), and import XTOC backups (roster + squads + keys + packets) into XCOM (unit pickers group by squad when available).
- XTOC Data: local-first packet archive - browse/search all stored XTOC packets (including non-location) and import geo packets to the Map overlay.
- Mesh: connect to a Meshtastic or MeshCore device (Web Bluetooth), import Meshtastic channel labels, view nodes heard, click a node to quick-set a DM destination, and send/receive messages on channels or direct.
- Logbook: fast QSO logging with ADIF/CSV export.
