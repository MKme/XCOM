Activate once with your license key while online, then keep using it offline on that device.

[SECTION: Long Description]
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING
- Offline-ready web app (PWA): installable on iOS/Android/Desktop. Once loaded, it keeps working without signal.
- Local-first data: personal lists and logs stay on your device (no accounts required).
- Offline mapping: set an AO and cache map tiles for that area to keep maps usable offline.
- Operator-focused tools: repeaters, packet nodes, shortwave schedules, callsign lookup, logging, and more.

KEY MODULES
- Predict: offline callsign lookup (USA/Canada), path plotting, and a quick HF prediction tool.
- Repeaters: find repeaters by radius/band/mode and view tones, offsets, notes, and distance.
- Packet Stations: map packet nodes/BBS and keep a personal local list.
- Shortwave Broadcasts: browse worldwide HF schedules by time ("what's on now") or by frequency.
- Map: AO selection + offline raster tile caching.
- XTOC Comm: create/import structured packets (CLEAR or SECURE), chunk for tight message limits, and move by copy/paste, QR, or mesh.
- Mesh: connect to a Meshtastic radio (Web Bluetooth) and send/receive messages.
- Logbook: fast QSO logging with ADIF/CSV export.
